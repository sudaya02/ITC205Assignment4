Bug 1: Game does not pay out at correct level.
When player wins on 1 match, balance does not increase.

Bug 2: Player cannot reach betting limit:
Limit set to 0, but game ends with player still with 5 (dollars) remaining.

Bug 3: Odds in the game do not appear to be correct.
Crown and Anchor games have an approximate 8% bias to the house. So the win : (win+lose) ratio 
should approximately equal 0.42. This does not appear to be the case.

Bug 4: Dice seem to always roll the same after first roll. Possibly related to Bug 3.
